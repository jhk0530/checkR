      <description>so basically i have data that i want to plot in r studio. however, everytime i put in my code, I keep getting an error message either saying:&#xA;&#xA; (Error in x[floor(d)] + x[ceiling(d)] : non-numeric argument to binary operator) or (Error in hist.default(tandp$streams, xlab = &#34;Streams on Spotify&#34;, main = &#34;Distribution of Spotify Streams&#34;,  :   &#39;x&#39; must be numeric)&#xA;&#xA;even though my values are numeric. I thought the problem was that my values had commas but i removed them and still got the same thing. i am in need of urgent help since my project is due is 12 hours. my values range from 3000-1000000000 so im not sure whats happening. all i’m trying to do is make a histogram or box plot of the distribution but r is not letting me :( if someone wants to run the code to see if they could help PLEASE by all means. </description>
