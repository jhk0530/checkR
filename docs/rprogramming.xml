      <description>Hey folks,&#xA;&#xA;I recently gave **Meet Hour** a shot for video conferencing, and honestly? It’s kinda underrated. It’s got a clean UI, smart features, and feels like a nice blend of Zoom, Google Meet, and even a bit of Calendly all in one.&#xA;&#xA;Here’s what I liked about it:&#xA;&#xA;✅ **No Downloads** – 100% browser-based. Just click the link and go.  &#xA;✅ **Secure** – End-to-end encrypted for private convos.  &#xA;✅ **Custom Branding** – Add your own logo, colors, etc. to the meeting room. Super clutch for businesses and coaches.  &#xA;✅ **Built-in Scheduling** – No need for extra tools – you can schedule, send invites, and set reminders.  &#xA;✅ **Live Streaming &amp;amp; Recording** – Go live on YouTube/Facebook or record meetings with one click.  &#xA;✅ **Interactive Features** – Whiteboard, polls, Q&amp;amp;A, hand raising – everything for engagement.  &#xA;✅ **Handles Large Groups** – Works well for webinars, events, and big teams.  &#xA;✅ **Affordable Plans + Free Tier** – There’s a free version, but the paid ones are really budget-friendly too.&#xA;&#xA;🔹 **And right now they’re offering 10% off all plans** with this promo code:  &#xA;**MHAFDIYEmehchx5a**&#xA;&#xA;I used it for a few client sessions and team calls, and the experience was super smooth. Might actually switch over full-time.&#xA;&#xA;Anyone else using Meet Hour? Would love to hear your thoughts!</description>
